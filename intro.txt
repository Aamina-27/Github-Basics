I’m someone who loves learning (sometimes not 🤷‍♀️), solving problems, and taking on new challenges. Right now, I’m interning but honestly, it doesn’t feel like it’s helping me grow. 
I’m more excited about my Automatic Pill Dispenser project, which got shortlisted for Unisys UIP Y16, though I still need to figure out the circuit connections and prep for a demo in 5 weeks.

My dad always says, "Don't bite off more than you can chew," and honestly, he’s right. 
I have this habit of taking on too much just because I’m curious and eager to win, but then I end up feeling stressed (doesn't matter coz the end result gives me more happiness). 
I love exploring new things, but sometimes I need to remind myself to pace it out.

I enjoy learning new languages , currently learning French and Urdu.

Overall, I’m always looking for new skills, better opportunities, and ways to make my work more meaningful. Plus, I have ChatGPT as my personal advisor, so that’s a bonus! 😄
